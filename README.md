# Colors

This is a package providing some color utilities. The brunt of the work was taken from [here](https://github.com/ozh/github-colors), I simply extended it with a random deterministic color for languages not found in GitHub's definition files.

There are also some light functionalities like converting from hex to hsl color formats.
